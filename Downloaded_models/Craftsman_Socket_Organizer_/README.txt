# Summary

I loved the Socket Orgainzer by WoodmanXI, but my Craftsman socket set was quite a bit different than that one and I needed to customize to hold all of the sockets in my particular set.

I ended up having to build the 3d models again, since I'm not talented enough with SketchUp to alter the existing files.  I based the layout, dimensions, etc on WoodmanXI's original design.

I'm still considering if I should model up trays for the various extensions, ratchets, and spark plug sockets.  

Socket sizes:
Standard Short 500 12pt - 1/2 inch drive - 3/8" to 1" in 16th increments
Standard Short 375 12pt - 3/8 inch drive - 1/4" to 13/16" in 16th increments
Standard Short 375 8pt - 3/8 inch drive - 1/4" to 1/2" in 16th increments
Standard Short 375 6pt - 3/8 inch drive - 1/4" to 1" in 16th increments
Standard Short 250 12pt - 1/4 inch drive - 3/16" to 3/8" in 32nd increments, 7/16", 1/2", 9/16"
Standard Short 250 6pt - 1/4 inch drive - 5/32" to 3/8" in 32nd increments, 7/16", 1/2", 9/16" 
Standard Long 500 12 pt - 1/2 inch drive - 1/2" to 7/8" in 16th increments
Standard Long 375 12 pt-revised - 3/8 inch drive - 3/8" to 3/4" in 16th increments, 7/8"
Standard Long 250 6pt and 12pt - 1/4 inch drive - 3/16" to 3/8" in 32nd increments, 7/16", 1/2", 9/16"
Metric Short 500 12pt - 1/2 inch drive - 9mm to 22mm
Metric Short 375 12pt - 3/8 inch drive - 6mm to 19mm, 21mm
Metric Short 375 6pt - 3/8 inch drive - 6mm to 21mm
Metric Short 250 6pt - 1/4 inch drive - 4mm to 14mm, 5.5mm
Metric Long 500 12pt - 1/2 inch drive - 13mm to 19mm
Metric Long 375 12pt - 3/8 inch drive - 9mm to 19mm
Metric Long 250 6pt - 1/4 inch drive - 4mm to 14mm

I found the Metric Long 375 12pt to be too big to print on my print bed (8" x 8").  So I split into multiple files

Alternate Files:
Metric Long 375 12pt - part 1-revised- 3/8 inch drive - 9mm to  14mm
Metric Long 375 12pt - part 2 - 3/8 inch drive - 15mm to 19mm

Hex Sockets:
Hex 375 - 3/8 inch drive for both Standard and Metric
Hex 250 - 1/4 inch drive for both standard and Metric
