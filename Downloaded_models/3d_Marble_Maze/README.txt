# Summary

3d Marble Puzzle Maze with 11mm holes.
Try to get the ball bearing through the whole maze from one hole to the other.  Find the secret chamber for an extra challenge!

You must supply a 3/8 inch ball bearing

- overhangs may cause trouble through some passages, shake the puzzle vigorously with the ball inside to bust up any obstructions.

# How I Designed This

## How the marble maze was designed in Tinkercad

I started with a 19mm cube, and tapered each edge.  I assembled all 27 cubes into a 3x3 cube and set to the side.
I designed the holes and tunnels with cylinders and spheres, rotating appropriately to make 90' turns, straightaways, and T intersections.
I grouped all the tunnels together, then aligned them with the 3x3x3 cube
