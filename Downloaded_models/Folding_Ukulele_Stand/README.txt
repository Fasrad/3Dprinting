# Summary

I designed this neat Ukulele Stand that folds flat to take along with you! Great for displaying your instrument, or for taking along for gigs, jams or recording sessions. Folded flat, it can fit in most gig bags. Parts can be printed with support for either concert or soprano ukuleles.

EDIT: Thanks to Israngkul, there is a new remix of this design for tenor Ukes now:

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: MakerBot
Printer: MakerBot Replicator 2
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: Medium, 2 shells
Infill: 10%

Notes: 
Select right and left .STL files that correspond to the type of Uke you will be using: filenames ending in _con for Concert, and _spr for Soprano models.
Update 7/29/2016: added updated left and right soprano leg files; they are shorter, will print faster and use less material. handy if you're fitting a soprano version of this stand into a gig bag. The files are named "ukestand_left_spr-V2.stl" and "Ukestand_right_spr-V2.stl" respectively. I'll be leaving the original version of the soprano files up for those that want them (they may offer more stability too.)
Update 8/06/2016: I designed a locking cap you can place on top of the open stand to prevent it from collapsing. thus eliminating the need for felt or tape on the hinge pin. It fits loosely, but works well. Felt can be glued to the beveled portion that your Ukulele's back will touch.  Israngkul's lock should also work with this design, and vice-versa in regards to my lock working with his remix. You can scale my lock down by 1 or 2 percent for a tighter fit, but it isn't required. Either lock will work, so it's a matter of preference. I'm working on a fold-flat lock mechanism as well to take up less space.

# Post-Printing

## Finishing and assembly:

Trim the helper disk off the head of the hinge pin prior to assembly if using the helper version.
Wrap some tape around the hinge pin if it's too loose, or cut a strip of felt the length of the pin about 6mm wide, and insert the strip through the aligned holes prior to installing the pin to add some friction, I also cut some felt washers to go in between the hinge segments to tighten it up. you can also use normal washers for this.

If you use felt or tape on the pin prior to installation, you won't need glue. Of course, you can super glue the head of the pin into the socket, and skip the felt, but it will be very loose, and your instrument might fall over if it's too loose.

you can also optionally add felt strips and pads under the feet and on the contact points where the stand touches your instrument like I did..

To use, unfold the stand with the legs at roughly a 90 degree angle from one another, with the heel of the stand pointed straight back. insert the Ukulele, and adjust the legs so they make contact with the body, and the back of the body contacts the heel; The ukulele should be almost completely vertical. If it leans back too far, the instrument may fall, and the stand will collapse. Once adjusted, It should hold it's position if the instrument is pulled straight up, and reinserting it straight down. Hinges can be taped over after set up for added security on location if desired. but it isn't required.
